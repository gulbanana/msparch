some flash oddities:
    [S] YOU THERE. BOY. (002153 / 00253) works ONLY if run through swfmill. seems that swix doesn't work either. weird! but it does work..
    the alterniabound style walkarounds break if swfmilled - which they don't need to be. however...
    [S] Past Karkat: Wake up. (004692 / 02791) DOES have to be milled, and as a consequence is sort of broken; you need to right click->play. 

- add proper navigation - back buttons and ideally lists/maps

- recheck the last page of a story to see if there's more to download

- fix darkcage links
